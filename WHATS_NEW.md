# Annotation Overhaul: Part 1
* New type of Annotations: Collections
    * Collections are annotation groups.
    * Collections can be created with the new ‚öÑ button.
    * Two special collections: Line Strip ( å) and Spoke (‚öπ).
        * Line Strip connects multiple lines together.
        * Spoke connects multiple lines to a single point like the spokes of a wheel.
        * By right clicking the the  å/‚öπ button, the annotation will automatically connect the segments together.
            * Right clicking the  å button will connect the end of the Line Strip to the beginning.
            * Right clicking the ‚öπ button will connect every line to the previously made line.
    * Collections can be completed via Ctrl+Double Click or by clicking the button again.
    * Right clicking a collection in list view will show/hide its children.
    * Collections have all the tags and segments of their children.
* Annotation Grouping
    * Hold ctrl while clicking an annotation in list view will allow you to select multiple annotations at once.
    * The ‚öÑ button will group these annotations together into a collection.
        * Note: The first selected annotation in the group will determine where the group will be created. For example, if many annotations are selected but the first one is already part of a parent collection, the new collection will be a child of that same parent.
    * The üí• button will remove all child annotations from a collection and relocate them to the parent of that collection.
        * **Note: Collections CANNOT be empty, so this will delete the collection.**
    * The ‚úÇÔ∏è button will remove the selected annotation(s) from its parent collection.
